## How ESLint Makes Me a Better React Developer
This resource talks about how using ESLint, a developer can be a developer. It allows a person to have consistency and abide by clean code roles and also, allow removal of unesscary code. 
  * Linting tools like ESLint allow developers to discover problems with their JavaScript code without executing it.
* ESLint is a file in a project repo called .eslintrc with a list of linting rules that runs through the project’s JavaScript code 
* This is awesome because not only does ESLint identify ways to make code better, but if you don’t need or don’t agree with certain rules, they can be changed or ignored (either for the line, for the whole file, or for the whole project).
