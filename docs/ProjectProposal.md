# __Filmther - Weather App for Film Makers__

## Application Definition Statement

Filmther is a weather app that is tailored towards cinematographers and film makers. When it comes to weather, a normal person just really need the basic information but when, it comes to cinematographers and film makers they need information more than just basic weather information. That's the purpose of Filmther. 

## Target Market

The main target market is film makers and cinematographers. It can also be used by students who are in the same industry. The secondary market can be the users who like to look at weather with more detailed information and photographers. 

## User Profile

Asif Khan Rennan: The user profile I will be using for my project. He's a recent film graduate from Full Sail University and has started working. He will be providing insight through which I can refine my App.



## Use Cases

Use Case: The app allows film makers to look at the weather in detail to have shots that require certain weather condition. For example, the director wants to take a shot that's very misty and foggy but director then, can look at the app; check the weather and see, when, it's the most foggy throughout the day. 

## Problem Statement

The problem is weather apps in the markets are they show information more relevant to general audiencer and is not tailored towards film makers.

## Pain Points

The weather apps don't show the information that most film makers need. One of them issues include, not having information about golden hour which can be essential to some of the shots in a film. 

## Solution Statement

My project will include as much as information it can include that is relevant to my target audience in a clean and user-friendly way that also, has a timeline feature. Just by scrolling on slider, The user can go forward in time and check the weather conditions. 

## Competition

There are few products that exist. The first one is Dark Sky which was sadly shut down on android because it was bought by Apple and there's a new product called Tmrw.io but it uses a subscription based model and the free version is plagued by ads.
